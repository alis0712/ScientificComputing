Good day!

Feel free to browse through some of the projects done in FORTRAN. 

The first project is a 2D truss model with 1D analysis done in FORTRAN and the overall objective of this project was to develop a finite element algorithm that allows a user to solve a truss structure with n number of elements. 

The algorithm allows the user to achieve the following:
i.  The algorithm provides a mesh generator that conforms to a specific truss 
ii. The mesh generated in (i) allows the user to take the mesh information and solves for a truss structure composed of 10-unit cells which are supported and loaded
iii. And it solves for the nodal displacements, the internal forces acting on each member, and the normal axial stresses acting in each memeber. An image showing the deformed and undeformed mesh is provided below: 


The second project is solving for a 1D cantilever beam using numerical methods. Here we were solving for the stresses, strains, and displacements. 
I used to two methods to solve this problem, one by using triangular elements and second using 4-noded isoparameteric elements and then did convergence studies to see which of the two took lesser time to get to a result.
